# Sierpinski Triangle

## Program

A simple 2D Sierpinski Triangle image generator.

## About

The Sierpinski triangle (also with the original orthography Sierpiński),
also called the Sierpinski gasket or the Sierpinski Sieve, is a fractal and
attractive fixed set with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle,
subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles. Originally
constructed as a curve, this is one of the basic examples of self-similar
sets, i.e. it is a mathematically generated pattern that can be reproducible
at any magnification or reduction. It is named after the Polish mathematician
Wacław Sierpiński, but appeared as a decorative pattern many centuries prior
to the work of Sierpiński.
